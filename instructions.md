# Instructions

## Creating a Personal Website

### Setting up the Project with Github

1. Create an account on github.com 
2. Rename the GITHUB_USERNAME.github.io file to **whatever your username is**.github.io
3. Create an empty repository on github with the same name as the dir in step 2. Do not add a README file or gitignore file
4. Follow the instructions to "... or create a new repository from the command line"
5. 10 times an hour you can push to this repo and check out NAME.github.io in your browser

### Getting started

1. Install Sublime Text. It's a popular text editor for developers. There's a deb file on the thumb drive for x64. 
2. Open the NAME.github.io directory in Sublime
3. Open the index.html file in your browser.

### HTML - Style not included

1. Read a little on the structure of a HTML page here: https://www.tutorialspoint.com/html5/html5_syntax.htm more tags can be found at http://html5doctor.com/
2. Change the index.html file to have information relevant to you with the tags you learned about in step 1. **Don't worry about how it looks!**

### Assets

#### CSS - Cascading Style Sheets

1. Read a little about how CSS works http://www.csstutorial.net/css-intro/introductioncss-part1.php. In the index.html file I've sent over there are examples of all 3 types of CSS inserts
2. There are tons of CSS styles you can apply to pages - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference
3. Add some CSS to your page to make it look nicer. Remove the style tag from the header and the style attribute on the page elements. Put all your style in the style.css file. We can break this up if it gets too big.
